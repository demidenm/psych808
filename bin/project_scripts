the leading number is indicative of the order in which they should be
run.

echo "00_setup_ds008"
echo "=============="
echo "
This will expand the ds008_raw.tar.gz file from the archive location into
the ~/Projects directory from which it is run.  It first checks to see if the
ds008 directory already exists, and it exits if it does to prevent accidental
overwrite.
"
echo

echo "========================="
echo "01_brain_extraction_ds008"
echo "========================="
echo "
This script will run the bet to do brain extraction on the highres001.nii.gz
anatomical image for all subjects.
"
echo


echo "====================="
echo "02_check_images_ds008"
echo "====================="
echo "
This will look in the dataset directory for image files for each subject in
    $subject/anatomy/highres001.nii.gz
    $subject/BOLD/task???_run???/bold.nii.gz
and print out header information about the dimensions for volumes, slices,
voxels, and the TR for functional time series (bold) files.
"
echo

echo "=========================="
echo "02_check_images_find_ds008"
echo "=========================="
echo "
This is the same as 02_check_images except that it uses find to locate the
bold.nii.gz files to avoid having to check for existence in the loop over
the bold files.
"
echo

echo "===================="
echo "03_fix_bold_TR_ds008"
echo "===================="
echo "
This script fixes the TRs in the bold files for the ds008 data set.  It
queries the bold file for the values of pixdim1-pixdim3, changes the TR
to the correct value of 2.000000 and prints the old and new values for
all four pixdims. It also creates a semaphore file, 00_TR_FIXED in the same
folder as the bold file, to indicate that this change has occurred.
"


echo "=========================="
echo "04_prepare_bold_data_ds008"
echo "=========================="
echo "
This script runs the fsl_motion_outliers command on all the functional bold
files in the data set and creates a file with any confound images in it, a
frame_displacement_vals.txt file with the actual framewised displacement
measure in it, and a frame_displacement_plot.png file, all in a newly created
motion_assess folder in the task/run folder with the bold file being assessed.
An empty confound.txt file is created if no confounds are found so that the
design.fsf file can refer to it regardless.  If rerun, the motion_assess folder
is removed first.
"
echo

echo "======================="
echo "setup-tmp-subject_ds008"
echo "======================="
echo "
This script will create a ~/Projects/tmp folder if needed and copy a subject
data folder into it. If the subject folder exists; it will not overwrite.
If the source folder does not exist, it will exit.
